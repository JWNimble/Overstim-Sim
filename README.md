# Overstim-Sim
Made in Touchdesigner using the Mediapipe external module. The Overstim Sim guides the user through an abstract representation of what it is like to experience a sensory overload resulting from a variety of triggers. 

The Main file that has everything is named "Overstim Sim Final.toe"

All other .toe files are tests of features that appear in that main file
